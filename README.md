# Traffic_Light_Control_Systems
The situation is we have two traffic lights. One allows cars to move from north to south, and the other one  allows cars to move from east to west. We also have pedestrian traffic light one beside each traffic light of the  two we have. The pedestrian has to press on a button to have his light green to cross the street safely.
